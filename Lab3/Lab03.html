            Traditional Approach: 
            As the assignment suggested I started with the traditional approach of @media and querries to make the design of the website responsive. While it was tricky to implement at the beggining 
            I can confidently say that as time went on I became more confortable in it and I ended up liking it a lot. Once I was happy with the look and responsiveness of my website I started 
            implementing the website with bootstrap framework.

            Bootstrap framework:
            I will be honest with the fact that it took me about 5 minutes to get the wesbite looking good with Bootstrap once I had it set up the traditional way. The amount of work 
            bootstrap cuts from website design is nothing short of impressive. Granted all this was after the painstaking process of learning and understanding the concepts of responsive design 
            and fluid grids. The facility and variety of tools it offers let you acomplish almost anything you want with few limitations.

            Conclusion: While I did like the shortcuts Bootstrap provided, I was not fully sold on it as it changed some of my original formatting that I implemented previously 
            in my traditionally designed website. However I am sure this is a matter than can be fixed when studying Bootstrap a little more in depth. My conclusion from this 
            assignment is that tools such as Bootstrap facilitate the process of designing a website. However, one must not fully depend 
            in these resources. Instead, one should aim to fully understand how all the concepts involved in web design work and then use those tools, as 
            the complete understanding of all these different concepts is what really makes a good web developer.
