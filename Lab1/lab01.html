            Hello, my name is Felipe Quiroga. I am currently in my second year of Computer Science at TMU. I am originally from Ecuador but I moved to Canada in 2018 with my parents and my little sister in the search of a better future. 
            I never really knew what I wanted to study when I grew up (even less that I was gonna end up in Canada), all I knew was it had to be somewhat related to math as it was my favourite subject. When I first came to Canada 
            I randomnly picked an introductory Computer Science because it seemed somewhat intresting and I was hooked. I inmediately knew that was what I wanted to study, and fast forward a few years here I am in my second year of university.

                In my spare time I don't really like to be indoors, specially in the summer I try to be outside as much as possible and play sports, specially Tennis and Squash, which are my main sports, but I also love Football (or Soccer as so anoyingly 
                called in North America), Volleyball, Ping Pong and basically any sport that uses a raquet.

                     I also love voluntering in my free time, specifically in Emmanuel Baptist Church East (my local latin church). I started attending EBCE in 2019 and have since gotten involved in many of its ministries. I currently form part of 
                    the worship ministry where I play the drums each Sunday Service as well as the youth ministry, where I am one of the leaders.

                I learned how to play the drums when I was 12 after a couple of lessons, but it didn't evolve into much until I joined my school's band 
                and I was able to improve my skills. When I got to Canada I saw there was the need of a drummer at EBCE so I joined the 
                worship ministry, where I've been playing for the better part of 3 years now every Sunday at 1pm during the service's worship.

                By far my favourite hobbie is traveling, I love going going to new places, having new adventures, meeting new people, and everything related to traveling.
                Although I have not had the chance to travel to a lot of the places I want to go, I am quite happy about the places I've been so far, and plan 
                on adding more to list soon!
